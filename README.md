## Features

üìñüîé Here's an overview of how the application works: [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/OcRtHLl347K4tvX4k2wv1r/OOP-Dictionary?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=zcr7pza7N1s0mNVp-0).

üîë Key points:
- Enhanced study engagement through gamification elements, including interactive "choose the right answer" and "reorder words to form correct sentences" games.
- Implemented a relational database schema using MySQL and JDBC for efficient data management, covering word, user, and game data to offer a personalized study experience.
- Integrated APIs from freedictionaryapi.dev and Google Translate to deliver comprehensive word definitions and translations, including support for long sentences, within the application.

## Notes for improvement

### ‚úÖ What's right:
- Led a team of three individuals, while independently researching and designing both UI and UX.
- Spent a lot of time working on the class diagram. I wanted to make the most of what I was taught. The result was quiet satisfying.

- We were scored 10 out of 10!

### ‚ùå What's wrong:
- At some point I did overestimate myself. Included some crazy UI features just to end up discarding all of them because I wasn't capable of implementing.
- Some features are unnecessary. Luckily we received advice from our teacher before things went too far.
